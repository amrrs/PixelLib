## Update: **The latest version of PixelLib now supports background editing in images and videos in just five lines of code.**


Pixellib is a library for performing segmentation of objects in images and videos. It supports the two major types of image segmentation: 

**1.Semantic segmentation**

**2.Instance segmentation**

Install PixelLib and its dependencies

**Install Tensorflow**:

Install latest version of tensorflow(Tensorflow 2.0+) with:

`pip3 install tensorflow`

If you have have a pc enabled GPU, Install tensorflow--gpu's version that is compatible with the cuda's version on your pc:


`pip3 install tensorflow--gpu`

**Install imgaug with**:

`pip3 install imgaug`

**Install Pixellib with**:

`pip3 install pixellib --upgrade`

**Visit PixelLib's official documentation on** [readthedocs](https://pixellib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Perform background editing in images and videos:
The following features are supported for background editing,

**1.Change image background with  picture**

**2.Assign a distinct color to the background of an image and a video**

**3.Blur the background of an image and a video**

**4.Grayscale the background of an image and a video**

## Implement both semantic and instance segmentation with few lines of code.

There are two types of Deeplabv3+ models available for performing **semantic segmentation** with PixelLib:

1. Deeplabv3+ model with xception as network backbone trained on Ade20k dataset, a dataset with 150 classes of objects.
2. Deeplabv3+ model with xception as network backbone trained on Pascalvoc dataset, a dataset with 20 classes of objects. 

**Instance segmentation is implemented with PixelLib by using Mask R-CNN model trained on coco dataset.**

**The latest version of PixelLib supports custom training of object segmentation models using pretrained coco model.**

**Note:** PixelLib supports annotation with Labelme. If you make use of another annotation tool it will not be compatible with the library. Read this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@olafenwaayoola/image-annotation-with-labelme-81687ac2d077) on image annotation with Labelme.
